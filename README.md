# Maven-Music-Customers-Churn-EDA

Maven Music is a streaming service thatâ€™s been losing more customers than usual the past few months, and would like to utilize data analytics to decipher patterns and factors influencing customer attrition, predict and address potential customer churn.
In this project we will use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to delve into the data, explore relationships between variables, gain idea into potential predictors of churn and prepare data for modeling.
